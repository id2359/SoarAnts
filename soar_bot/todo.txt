Ants are separate agents, so they no longer know who has already decided to move where.
So I need some kind of thing on the input link to say where ants have decided to move to already.

DONE

Now I need to:
1) Weight global rl rule updates by the number of times each rule was updated, not by the number of moves that agent made.
For this, I need to use the version on Soar on Daidalos that includes printing update counts when you print a rule.

2) Give reward to each agent on an individual basis -- this may not be possible?
