Ants are separate agents, so they no longer know who has already decided to move where.
So I need some kind of thing on the input link to say where ants have decided to move to already.

DONE

Now I need to:
1) Weight global rl rule updates by the number of times each rule was updated, not by the number of moves that agent made.
2) Give reward to each agent on an individual basis -- this may not be possible?
